    About us
    Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, highlighting stories of 
    coffee from around the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from 
    bean to brew - in every shipment.

    Our commitment
    We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to 
    make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts 
    at the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days 
    a year trying to understand the challenges and opportunities in each of these places.
    We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers 
    through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community 
    initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast 
    each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.

  <section id="about-c">
    Uncompromising quality
    Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, 
    we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the 
    coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast 
    consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
