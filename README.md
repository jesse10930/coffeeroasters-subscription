## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- Sass for styling
- Figma for design
- Node Sass for development

### What I learned

My goal with this project was to keep things simple and see how the work I've put into my coding over the past several months has helped to develop my skills. I wanted to focus on planning the project well, writing clean JavaScript, using HTML semantics, and writing custom CSS classes.

I'm happy with how smoothly this project went. I feel like my coding skills are growing and the whole process continues to become more familiar. I'm particularly happy with how quickly I was able to solve any issues that arose when writing the functionality fo this site.

### Continued development

I still struggle a bit with organizing folders/files. Not sure when to add to an existing file or just make a new file and link it to the main project, particulraly with JavaScript files.
